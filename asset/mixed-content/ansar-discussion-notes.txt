*** switch
*** location
*** replaces - http requests, restful, websockets. urlencoded, protobuf, JSON, AMQP, MQTT

its a telephone switch for computers
organization uses a PBX to connect its staff
organization uses a message switch to connects its operational software

it connects clients to servers whatever their respective locations;
* on the same computer
* in the same LAN
* across the Internet

replaces multiple different networking techniques and libs with a single,
universal method. instead of some combination of;

* http requests, websockets
* application/x-www-form-urlencoded, protobuf, JSON
* socket listen/connect, client libs for AMQP, MQTT

single method of communication.

* send(message, address)

Services publish names and clients subscribe to those names. The
platform matches subscribers to publishers and arranges for the
most efficient connection.

This allows widely distributed pieces of software can operate as
a coherent group.

Each organization can operate multiple message switches and the platform
is multi-tenanted, i.e. supports multiple organizations.

***** CLAIMS *****
*** networking
*** scopes
*** all
Happy to debate with software developers;
* the most effective way to write networking software
* the most effective way to develop multi-processing software
* the most effective way to develop multi-host (i.e. LAN) software
* the most effective way to develop multi-LAN (i.e. Internet) software
* the only way to develop software that does all of the above

***** BENEFITS *****
*** quick
*** responsive, reliabile, reconnect
*** fire
*** logs from core
*** decentralize

* shorter time to market
* shorter maintenance cycles (development velocity)
* responsiveness, resource efficiency, scalability
* robustness and reliability
* network failure detection including loss of infrastructure and NAT failures
* automated reconnect with backoff and randomization
* enables advanced features, e.g. db is on fire
* improved support (automated, always-on logging)
* allows for decentralization (avoid complexity and cost of IAAS) where appropriate

***** STANDOUTS *****
*** M A K F S D

* multi-virtual networking over single physical network
* auto selection of optimal transport
* automated reconnection with backoff/random
* public key crypto
* fan out
* services in scopes - security
* relocation is trivial
* decentralization
* 
* 

***** TECHNICAL *****
Connection method is optimal for the circumstance. The platform detects
connections to processes on the same computer, processes on the LAN
or processes across the Internet, and arranges for the best method of
communication;

* TCP connect across loopback (127.0.0.1)
* TCP connect across LAN (e.g. 192.168.1.122)
* brokered connection through online relay service (similar to MQTT)

Location of the communicating parties has no influence on software. Code executes
the same. This is HUGELY different to the norm for networking software.
