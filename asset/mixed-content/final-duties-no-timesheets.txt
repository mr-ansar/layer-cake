all branches are clean. on timesheets. what is the start date?

Latest I can find from you is to end of March 2021
If you weren't keeping running timesheets while you were working, it's probably not worth the effort to try and reconstruct them

In that case don't worry about it - the amount of effort to attempt to reconstruct vs. utility doesn't stack up
