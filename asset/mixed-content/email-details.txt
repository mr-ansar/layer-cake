****************** FINALLY, SOMETHING THAT WORKS ***********************************

The article from Medium;

https://ppc-automation.medium.com/python-send-email-without-smtp-server-754f4782b7f6

Follow the process as described. Its pretty short and almost follows what is on
screen. Some of the prose is ESL.

Note that first code fragment is not a piece of python to be run separately. It
just defines a function that is called by the second code fragment.

The end result is a piece of code that can send emails (with subjects and bodies)
to recipients without any ongoing concerns about authentication. This is dependent
on the presence of a "token file" (named as "token.json" in the Medium doc). That
file is a by-product of an initial run that uses the downloaded "credentials
file" to pop-up an oauth window.

Any "backend server" based on this technique for sending emails will require an
"initial run" or there needs to be a separate utility that can be executed to
generate the token file from the credentials file, before the server attempts
operational status.
