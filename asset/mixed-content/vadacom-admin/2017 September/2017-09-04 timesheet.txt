looking at different auto-logging in messaging layer - where will it create its own log?
how will it run, i.e. logging is not an async protocol - all one way, flooding,
control over quantity.

documented fundamental design of logging, sent to nic.
discussed several different points about possible logging traffic and
what might be useful and also realistic.
plumbing/machinery of logging for webman looking quite defined+stable.
ability to cope with potential traffic is crucial.
there is no way that a new version of webman can log everything(e.g. every Asterisk AMI event)
so there needs to be a way in which objects can be manipulated as auto-loggers or not.
configurations of these settings can then be applied atomically, i.e. the entire product
is in one of several defined logging configurations. these can focus on the different
areas of app activity (at the expense of others) while also preserving operational
integrity.
