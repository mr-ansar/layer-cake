discussion with gerwin about "next step"
gerwin directed me to current code that is working for the ui
messaging work will be to replace the sync code;

	connector.read(dn)
	
inside webman/modules/phonebook, with async version.

to do that however - need the work from the messaging layer branch.
branches will not be merged/rebased until after review/accept.

2-4.30
network hassles. redmine homepage fine but tasks list link goes nowhere
status update to nic - he says okay review needs to happen.
software sketching of what connector.read work will look like
early finish cos of network (reboot needed?) and relocation
