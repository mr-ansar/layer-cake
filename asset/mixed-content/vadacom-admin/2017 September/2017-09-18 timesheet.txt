refresh the intended async to-do list
start with modules/ldap/LDAPConnectionObject.read
work through how this interacts with python ldap library
investigate the python ldap library
2-6
suggested 2 different async architectures to gerwin.
1. multiple reader threads calling result2(), one request per thread
2. single reader thread, multiple pending requests (capped) and single reader thread.
going for option 2 which pre-supposes that the ldap lib can cope with
related multiplexing and accepting that the performance of a particular
request has more potential to be affected by the queueing of responses
when there is multiplexed activity on a single wire.
got some initial feedback from nics code review. python no-nos that
must be removed. minor except that it becomes a difficult automated
compilation. atm reverting to manual mappings cos it can make
explicit mod.mod.Message references.
