trying different manual approaches to dispatch table construction
several hassles with staticmethod mechanism.
discussions with nic and team.
chucked all that noble approach and went for global funcs and assignment of class.mapping.
hassles with testing proved to be due to LAN preventing host-to-host comms.
discussed with gerwin.
2-6
reconfigured vms (dt_vada_1 and vadaxchange) to  use interfaces as proscribed by gerwin
a few bounces and reconfigs later and everything now working
using host-only network interfaces that uses vm host as gateway+dhcp
finished upgrade of ansar and managerclient to the new manual mapping.
upgraded manager client to non-star (import ansar as ml) import.
tested on pbx and also test_ansar unit tests.
added the full ansar logging model and implemented mapping to webman Logger.
