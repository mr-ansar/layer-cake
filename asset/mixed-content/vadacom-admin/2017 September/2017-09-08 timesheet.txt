9-11
completed all logging integration and functional testing
12-5
refactored all module names and use of import for code review
many issues here but prob for the best
as of EOW still stuck on getting it to run - assignment and then
read access to variables across modules is a bit dodgy
a new strategy to allow looseness (import *) during dev and then
lock it down after modules are stable
hope the reviewer likes it
