cleaning up implementation of;
custom/default logging flags
assignment of flags to classes and instances (i.e. Points and Message)
adding in the logging calls

completed all automated call logging sites
converted to single-threaded-log machine and
all log sites posting to the thread.modified
queue to allow for blocking on max size.
verified operation including messaging layer teardown
worked on integration such that client app can supply
