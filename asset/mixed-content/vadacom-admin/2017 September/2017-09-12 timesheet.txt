checked all testing and webman operation
some pre-code review audit details to cleanup.
all related to the fact i used messaging_demo as my reference
without making same updates in the test/ansar/test_ansar.py file
fixed code to point that unit tests run to ok completion.
but there is a dangling issue with the fact that i cant currently
shutdown the logging object and the zombie object causes a
diagnostic from nostest during process shutdown.

updated redmine moved #2286 to review by nic and updated
gerwin with details so that he can do so as well.
checked out gerwins phonebook code and doing diff/review of
all his changes.
discussed dangling log thread problem with nic.
figured out a fix but questionable quality.perhaps better than
not having it at all (added sleep).
