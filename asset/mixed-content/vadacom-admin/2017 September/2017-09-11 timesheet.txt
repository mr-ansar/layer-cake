completed refactor of modules
several fixes required where root and others were accessing variables
that are now in point module (timer_address and log_address)
attempted use of Message/Point constructors as the store of execution
flags, rather than using separate ObjectFrame library. Looked really
good until i tried to implement uniform logging capability for custom
routines - arse.

Completed move of demo/test into webman test framework
Initially this assumed each test framed with root_object/stop_root
but currently this is not possible and retreated to calling this
pair of functions during setup/teardown of test module.
Replaced star import in ansar with explicit names
Headers and comments for all modules
Completed move from messaging folder to ansar
