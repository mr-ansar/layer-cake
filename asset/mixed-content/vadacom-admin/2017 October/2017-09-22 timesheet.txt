gerwin and balsamiq - not purchased yet?
more conversion of Phonebook and PhonebookLDAPUserManager from connector (sync) to mux (async),i.e.
actually PhonebookManager needed it as  well.

some networking (hassles with broken lan) with nic
testing an "async call" method after changes to phonebook/ldap - so many instances.
designed+implemented "Queue.ask"
bit of supporting cruft in Queue ctor but makes for very small callsite
added the "Queue.stop" method which was absolutely required (root_stop) and
ended up being a special case .... ask-address-to-stop.
updated phonebooks to use the new method.
