took that long to finally recover a test-rig for #2183.
problem is that the work has been in buddy and there is a branch for that
but the backend has to match
even if the code never changes in the backend you need to test buddy+webman with matching versions.
started recovery yesterday avo after discussions with enpei suggesting fixes are possible in buddy startup.

verified that previous bug is still there - set the location filter, apply, see correct results.
close the page and start again
filter works properly but multiselect control does not contain the selection(s).
both close page (x) and logout seem to be producing the same results when
i thought the bug was in the latter.
implemented enpei's improvement
no change
some debugging breakpointing and investigations
