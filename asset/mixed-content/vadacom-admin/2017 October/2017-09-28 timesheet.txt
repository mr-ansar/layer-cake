debugging #2183
only place that calls multiselect during init is locationFilterChanged
the value of the ids list is 0 (a zero) which is horrid rep of null list, but maybe ok in js.
tried different approaches to fix including forced call from main controller
that pulls that data from store and pushes to control.
data always 0 (zero).
