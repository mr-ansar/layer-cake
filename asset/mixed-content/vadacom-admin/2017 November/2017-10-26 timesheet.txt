very minor spelling mistakes
damn prob with _build folder being in repo "came back". fixed "again".
standup with nic.
general discussion
agreed to rebase current email branch from develop and use latest frontend repo
2-6
verified rebase commands - multiple times
missed one "git pull --rebase"
needed after the "git fetch" and before the "git rebase develop"
so had to do it a second time
there were conflicts with damn arg ordering changes i hadmade
resolved in first rebase not notified in second
somehow ended up in the source (!!!!) so webman wouldnt load
bah. wonderful
then fun trying to fix same-old-buddy-start problem - no tab content after login complete.
tried many fixes
eventually saw the page populate, i.e. no fix needed just wait for several mins for page to populate.
argh. fun with hairloss thrown in.
