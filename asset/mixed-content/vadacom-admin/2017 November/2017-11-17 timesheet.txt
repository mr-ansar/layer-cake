11-1
heaps of fun with getting win10 and ubuntu dev vms loaded, configured
got openvpn working on the new ubuntu
got the win10 working to the point that downloading is possible  
2-6
eventually realized that laptop does not have the resources (cpu/ram) to support
both win10 tapi activity and ubuntu webman activity
