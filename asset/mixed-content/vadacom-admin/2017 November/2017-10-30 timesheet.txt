11-1
for a variety of reasons email server (exim) within webman backend was not pushing
out the emails. looked at logs fiddled config tried again.
consulted with gerwin
tried again
2-6
consulted with gerwin and provided resulting logs
eventually gerwin consulted jet config
discovered that i had tls-related configs flipped around
so finally, have network, buddy and email servers all working
i.e. an actual test bed for the code+debug cycle to begin.
nastiest was the incredibly slow startup of buddy causing
me to think that it was broken when probably for a long time
it just hadnt completed. sigh.
hang on. havent got db in there yet - tomorrow.
