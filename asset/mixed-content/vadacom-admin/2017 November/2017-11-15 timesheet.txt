10-1
various attempts to create win10 vm for tapi dev
upgraded vbox
initially existing webman+buddy vms run
but complain about old vbox additions
upgrading vbox additions kills the vm entirely
reverted to backed up vms but no networking available
2-6.30
ugrades appear to crap on host networking
more fiddling
eventually rebooted host
networking in host apparently restored
some setup of the win10 tapi dev vm.
enough for today.
