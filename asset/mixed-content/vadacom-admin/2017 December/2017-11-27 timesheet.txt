Tried different techniques to get uninstall shortcut working - no dice.
Checked system (control panel) access and seems fine.
Remove from shortcuts
Tried dbugview from shortcut.
Convenient but app complains about lack of access to kernel msgs
Need to rght-click and run as administrator
Gives access to messages and to the log file prepared by the installer.
Battled misbehaving network adaptors.
Always tested tapi calling even though working on shortcuts and
sometimes it would not work. Sometimes it required reboots.
Might be related to vbox implementation of nics (esp host only)
but unresolved. Seem to get to a better place and now havent
had a repeat for a while.
Only thing left is the broken documentation.
Oh need to repeat for 32-bit as well.
