review for ben
minor feedback, re-assigned to ben
back to ldap.
short discuss with gerwin
1-6
several iterations before a reasonably function version
of the sketch that i had in place before ansar arrived
only glitch so far is that LDAP client lib does not run
as expected so doesnt match the operational model that
i placed around it,e.g. it appears that you cannot call
the result2 function if there are no calls currently
pending. what a crock.
