review with nic
2-4, 6-9.30
discuss ldap/phbk with gerwin on chat
drop review to unblock gerwins progress
cherry-picked onto new -v2 ldap branch as indicated by gerwin
fixed minor mismatches in coding, i.e. ansar api had been upgraded
eventually realized i was starting actual impl of async ldap/phbk work
this was sketched out as much as possible but never ran cos ansar under review.
queried gerwin whether he wants me to complete that phase. keen to do so.
