11-1
driver looking ok  so moved onto sorting the repo - branches
the repo had been left in disarray and i didnt help by adding to develop
the last release was on a separate branch that had never been merged
merged everything so all in-sync
setup feature branch for getting it all working
3-9
used different files from different branches to compile a working driver
and complete docs that is also installable,operational.
battled linker dependencies and missing icons in docs.
the tapi development cycle is the worst.
