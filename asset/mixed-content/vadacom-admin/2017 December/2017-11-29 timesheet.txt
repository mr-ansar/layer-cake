4-9
Late start after extra time yesterday.
Recovered doc and self-terminating call code
Removed materials resulting in out-of-date linkage dependencies
Got docs almost there (missing icons only) and driver installing without issues
Calls to webman complete as expected with auto termination.
All good.
Then tried a subsequent call and MS dialer puts up "internal error" msgbox and requests app termination.
Bouncing the app certainly restores proper tapi driver interaction
But this combination of code and platform only reliable for a single call.
Decided to install a secondary test client and also the ultimate customer client - outlook
Spent the next 40mins trying to convince edge to not dispaly MS outlook pages (e.g. download)
in the local language - indonesian. bangsat monyet software.
Will use workaround of downloading in host (chrome) and copying across.
The code-fresh vm-install-configure-test cycle for tapi dev is... the worst.
