CAPTURING

DESIGN MATERIALS
full schematic - library, app repos, build process, system definitions, auto-deployments, decommissioning
schematic of process - main, args, stdio, cwd, home, sys-def
schematic of process/group/host/lan/internet
developer, tester, user, tech support - examine, recent logs, control

PRODUCT OWNERSHIP
platforms - linux/mac/windows, code and unit-testing
dropping versioning
dropping ansar-encode CLI

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
unit testing for all
24x7 testing
auto-testing of doc examples
wan service - testing and watchdog
alarms

ENCODING AND DECODING
use python type system? tuples of any

Integer1/2/4/8
Unsigned1/2/4/8
Float4/8
Character/String
Byte/Block/Passthru/Piping
Rune/Unicode

consistent parsing - command line args, urlencoded, logged samples, etc
drop support for multiple encodings? how will that work for networking/config? config has to be JSON?
files and folder
type system
fully-parsed type expressions
no need for address types? just special handling of int vectors? X need them for sending inside messages
use standard file exceptions
custom encoding, parser, async, non-greedy for networking/configuration (response to elephant-in-network)
parsed type expressions
using yield for both input and output to avoid large blocks

STANDARD PROCESS
processes as DLLs - command lines, args, exit codes, stdin/out/err
auto-create runtime context - cwd, $HOME, $INSTALLED, .ansar-xxx, application access to context, sub-process == sub-context
execution as network components or CLI tools
ar.log() for pre-startup logging
starting of apps - ar.create
ending of apps - cleanup of networking and/or child objects, always use onexit? stop child processes
use within sync apps
packaging of callbacks - OnCompleted, OnProgress

STANDARD CONNECTION CAPABILITIES
keepalive as "normal" protocol
future proofing of diffie-hellman - next encrypt for quantum

DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE
deployment as first distributed product - ftp, FileTransferSend (actual FSM for tx), FileTransferServer, FileTransferGet (instruction message to server), FileTransferPut
pyinstaller vs interpret

PUB/SUB USES
using pub-sub within process to find singletons
strategy for multiple publishers - persistent uuid and datetime?
network bridging

CLOUD SERVICE
website - signup, monitoring webpage as first production combo of http/l7 hybrid
